# Hero-Me
This is an app from DevSlopes.com course and
it is my first android app. Its function is to find which hero you are from your choices. 
As you can see at the first picture, firstly,you need to choose your powers origin. Next, you need 
to choose your powers type and in the end, the app finds which hero you are and what's your backstory.
